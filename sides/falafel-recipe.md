Ingredients:

1 cup dried chickpeas
1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped
1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 small onion, chopped
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
Salt to taste
Oil for frying

Instructions:

Soak the chickpeas in water overnight. Drain them well before using.
In a food processor, combine the soaked chickpeas, parsley, cilantro, garlic, onion, cumin, coriander, cayenne pepper (if using), and salt. Pulse until everything is finely chopped and well combined, but not pureed.
Transfer the mixture to a bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Heat oil in a deep skillet or pot over medium heat.
Form the falafel mixture into small balls or patties using your hands or a spoon.
Carefully place the falafel into the hot oil and fry until golden brown and crispy, about 3-4 minutes per side.
Once cooked, remove the falafel from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.
Serve the falafel hot with your favorite sauces, salads, or in pita bread.
Enjoy your delicious homemade falafel!
